# SysML v2 Parser - Expected Failures
#
# This file lists corpus files that are expected to fail parsing.
# The list MUST shrink over time as parser bugs are fixed.
#
# Format: One file path pattern per line
# - Use relative paths from references/sysmlv2/
# - Use **/ prefix for "any directory" matching
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Empty lines are ignored

# =============================================================================
# Corpus Errors - Files with syntax that doesn't match xtext grammar
# =============================================================================

# Uses 'usecase' (one word) instead of 'use case' (two words)
# xtext grammar requires: 'use' 'case' (see SysML.xtext line 2276)
**/SE_Models/EIT_System_Use_Cases.sysml

# Uses 'as' instead of 'for' in alias declaration
# xtext grammar requires: 'alias' ... 'for' memberElement (see SysML.xtext line 418)
